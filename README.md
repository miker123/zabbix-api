# zabbix-api
Extending The Zabbix API. Based on zabbix-gnomes and pyzabbix

To run these scripts, please install pyzabbix, via pip install pyzabbix 
And download zabbix-gnomes at https://github.com/q1x/zabbix-gnomes/blob/master/zeventfinder.py

I was given a very short period of time to build a zabbix environment, and these were some of the scripts that I created. These will need to get polished and refined before use in a large scale environment. But I wanted to give them back to the community as I realized these scripts could be very useful
